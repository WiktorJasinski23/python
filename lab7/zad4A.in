 Graphical block-based programming language Scratch has entered the TIOBE index top 20. At first sight this might seem a bit strange for a programming language that is designed to teach children how to program. But if you take into account that there are in total more than 50 million projects "written" in Scratch and each month 1 million new Scratch projects are added, it can't be denied any more that Scratch is popular. Since computers are getting more and more an integral part of life, it is actually quite logical that languages to teach children programming are getting popular. Some years ago there was competition between Scratch and Alice which language would become the new "Logo" programming language of the modern ages. Alice is now at position #90 of the TIOBE index so it seems clear who has won. Possible reasons why this happened is that Scratch is easier to learn (a critical success factor in this field) and Scratch is sponsored by companies such as Google and Intel. - Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
